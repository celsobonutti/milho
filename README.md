The cat that named the eval module, Canjica, has passed away.

He's missed by all of us, and left a mark on me that I can not even start explaining.

Canjica, you were the best orange boy I've ever met, and I'll miss and love you forever.

Rest in peace, my baby.

Milho (corn in portuguese) is a toy dialect of Lisp written as a way to learn more about compilers.
There are implementations in:
- [Haskell](https://github.com/celsobonutti/milho)
- [Rust](https://github.com/celsobonutti/milho-rust)
- [Go](https://github.com/danfragoso/milho)
- [OCaml](https://github.com/renatoalencar/milho-ocaml)

## Running locally

You'll need `stack` installed on your computer. Then, simply run:

- `stack run <path-to-file>` to run the code from a file. (protip: there's a repl on `examples/repl.milho`)
- `stack test` to run the tests

## Using milho

If you want to know more about the language, check [the language docs](LANGUAGE.md).  

For a simple yet comprehensible documentation for the built-in functions, check [the built-in docs](BUILTINS.md).  

Standard library is still WIP and its docs are yet to be made, but you can check its code on `std/`
